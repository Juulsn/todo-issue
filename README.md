# todo-issue[action]

---

## Disclosure

Huge thanks to [JasonEtco](https://github.com/JasonEtco)! After he decided to shut down
his [todo[bot]](https://todo.jasonet.co/) I've looked around for alternatives but decided to create a new
implementation. Parts of his work can be found in this repository.

## Usage

The **todo-issue** action is super easy to use. Once you've [set up the action](#setup), simply push some code (via
commit or pull request). If the code you pushed includes one of the configured keywords (default is `TODO`), then the
action will either
**create** a new, **close**, **update** or **add a reference** to an existing issue for you using the comment you wrote
or changed in your code!

If I pushed this:

```js
/**
 * TODO Should we reinvent the wheel here?
 * We already have a good one. But could it be even rounder?
 */
function getWheel() {
    // Returns you this pizza like thing
}
```

**todo-issue** would create a new issue:

**Note:** While the above example is in javascript, **todo-issue** works in any language as long as you provide a
valid [styling](#Styling).

## Setup

There are a couple of [configuration options](#available-options) in case you need to change the default behaviour.

The defaults are likely fine for most projects, so you might not need to change them.

This yml is a good starting point. You should not tweak the triggers, except for the branch

```yml
name: Create issues from TODOs

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      importAll:
        default: false
        required: false
        type: boolean
        description: Enable, if you want to import all TODOs. Runs on checked out branch! Only use if you're sure what you are doing.
  push:
    branches: # do not set multiple branches, todos might be added and then get referenced by themselves in case of a merge
      - main
      - master

permissions:
  issues: write
  repository-projects: read
  contents: read

jobs:
  todos:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Issue Bot
        uses: juulsn/todo-issue@main
        with:
          excludePattern: '^(node_modules/)'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Labels

Add labels with \[square brackets\] at the end of a comment, to tag your issue with these tag

```
// TODO make this button red [frontend]
// this button should be red to clearify something
```

The above comment will add a frontend label to your GitHub Issue

### Import all

There is also an option to import all TODOs to GitHub Issues by running the workflow manually in the actions tab.

**Note:** This can't be undone and should be used super carefully. Don't forget to set your exclude paths in the
excludePattern regex.

### Styling

There are not many things to pay attention to.

- In front of a keyword only symbols and whitespace are allowed
- If you want the body of a comment to be added to the issue, you have to use the exact same characters as in front of
  the title keyword

For instance this:

```
//+TODO We have to do something about this
//-there is an error at line 28
```

would result in a new issue without a body because `//+` is not equal to `//-` (also counts for whitespace!)

### Task Systems

Currently, the bot only supports GitHub Issues. However, all requests to the APIs are handled through an interface, 
which makes it easy to support multiple.
If you want to add support for another task system, you are welcome to contribute and / or file an issue
